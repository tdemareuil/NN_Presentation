# Teaching Neural Networks

Neural Networks and Deep Learning explained in simple words and with visual examples.

You'll find here a presentation I am building to present neural networks in the most intuitive way possible, including explanations about theoretical bases and use-case examples.

Once completed, I will probably try to encapsulate it in a blog post, or a more readable HTML format article.

You can download the current version available in this repository as `NN_presentation.pdf`.
